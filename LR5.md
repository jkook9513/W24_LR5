# Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

1. After I programmed the grading script and ran it with `ListExamplesTests.java`, I keep getting this message that there was a failure in one of the tests, but I'm not sure how I should go about finding the bug.

I know that the problem is somewhere in the second test in `ListExamplesTests.java`, but I'm not sure what or where exactly the bug is. Below I have attached a screenshot of the tests that were ran. Any suggestions on how to approach this?
